I am an Assistant Professor of Psychology in Education at the University of Birmingham. Prior to this, I was a research fellow in the Department of Experimental Psychology at University of Oxford. I obtained my Ph.D. in Psychology at University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA. My research examines the role of language experience on language and literacy development, as well as its impact on the formation and expression of social-cultural representations, such as gender and emotions. My research approach is interdisciplinary, combining knowledge and skills of (1) psychological experiments using paradigms of word learning and sentence processing, (2) corpus linguistics using Natural Language Processing and (3) computational modelling and neural network approaches.

Hsiao, Gao & MacDonald (2014) and Hsiao & MacDonald (2016) further delved into the language statistics-production link. By manipulating animacy in Mandarin relative clauses and pro-drop sentences, I explored production preferences. The results indicated semantically-driven interference in sentence production, aligned with similar comprehension behaviors. This finding challenged syntactic-driven explanations, reinforcing the concept of "Production-Distribution-Comprehension" and the interconnected role of language statistics in shaping both comprehension and production processes.
